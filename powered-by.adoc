= Contact App

The Contact App is a contact management application developed for link:http://eurocommercial.com[Eurocommercial].
This app originated out of our users' need to quickly look up different employees of Eurocommercial's.
At the same time the app managers would need to be able to easily edit or add to the existing contact information.
We decided to create different Contact Groups consisting of multiple Contacts, each with their role within the group.

== Apache Isis with Ionic

Because of the requirements of the app - quick and portable access - we decided to create a mobile app for it
using the link:http://ionicframework.com/[Ionic Framework]. For the backend we decided to use Apache Isis
since this allowed us to rapidly develop the required backend application and surface a REST API to which the
mobile application could connect. We found that it worked together quite well, and with part of the team
behind Estatio we were able to create an app that is clear to use and manage.

As one of the first Apache Isis apps that makes use of mobile technologies this opens the doors for more to follow.
Now that the waters have been tested regarding creating a mobile apps with Apache Isis, the next step could very well be
a general Apache Isis viewer for mobile applications.
